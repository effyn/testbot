# testbot
Chat bot w/ [Sang Le](https://github.com/sle11).
Currently, the bot connects with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) but [slixmpp](https://github.com/poezio/slixmpp) may be an option in the future.

## Installation
You'll need to create a `token.txt` file in the root of the repository to connect to Discord.
After that, use `python main.py` in a terminal or double-click `main.py` if your environment supports it.
